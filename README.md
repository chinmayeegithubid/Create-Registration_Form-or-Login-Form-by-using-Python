# Create-Registration_Form-or-Login-Form-by-using-Python

This code creates a simple registration form using the Tkinter library in Python. It defines labels, entry fields, a checkbox, and a submit button, all organized in a grid layout. The heading is set at the top of the window. The getvals function is called when the submit button is clicked, printing "Accepted" to the console.
